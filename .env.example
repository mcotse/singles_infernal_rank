# Three-Environment Setup
# ======================
#
# 1. DEV (default) - mock auth, no Firebase needed
#    .env.development is checked in and works out of the box.
#    Run: bun run dev
#
# 2. STAGING - real Firebase with a separate staging project
#    Copy this file to .env.staging and fill in your staging Firebase values.
#    Run: bun run dev:staging
#
# 3. PRODUCTION - real Firebase with the prod project
#    .env.production is populated by GitHub Actions secrets.
#    Run: bun run build
#
# Firebase Configuration (needed for staging and production)
# Get these from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Your apps > Web app
